# Django
* Installing django
  pip install django
## now inside django folder when you run it first time 
let say you create a project name wordcount then another folder name wordcount will be created halong with manage.py
and inside the second wordcount folder you will see 4 files and a folder
- __pycache__ folder
- init.py
- settings.py
- urls.py
- wsgi.py

**now let me explain these files one by one**
> **pycache**--> This is just on your computer it's going to be generated every time that you're running the server doing new things And so these are just sort of internal files you don't need to worry about these at all.
> **__init__.py**-->This is a pretty advanced Django thing.

> **settings.py**-->we are going to be touching this a lot
